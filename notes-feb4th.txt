Creating a new file and writing to it:

---- "with open" keeps the file opened while going through the
     block of code and will close the file once it reaches
     the end of the block of code.

---- the 'w' within the open function tells the code that you are
     writing to the program instead of reading

---- the "as my_file" gives the code an object to mess with and
     put data into. the write function after the dot operator
     puts the text into the file object you just created

---- "my_file" can be called anything and works the same way
     as for loops when writing: for 'val' in vals (basically
     declaring the variable name for the file)

with open('tmp.txt', 'w') as my_file:
	my_file.write('hello, world')
